# MysteryMod Mixin Workspace

## Addon

To write generic code for all versions, use the mystery-mod-addon as source set for that. If you want to use version
 specific code, then use the version module.

## Get Started

To get started simply run the Setup run configuration or the setup gradle task.
IMPORTANT: Rightclick all the "jars" modules in IntelliJ's gradle window and click "Ignore Gradle projects"
(otherwise you're going to have duplicate content roots)

## Mixin

You will find in every version module example configurations for a mixin.

## Debug

To Debug an Addon, you can run the Minecraft <Version> run configuration and all will be done for you.
